Autocore
========

Autocore is a pre-configured application core designed for building declarative modular applications.

Autocore is built on top of Autofac providing automatic dependency configuration through marker interfaces.

Some of Autocore's features include:
- Zero configuration dependency injection (no XML config file, no custom initializer code to register types, etc.)
- Declarative component registration by implementing marker interfaces
- Scoped dependencies including Singleton (shared instance), Instance (always create a new instance), Volatile (per-scope instance, e.g. per-request).
